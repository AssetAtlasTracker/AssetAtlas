# General design philosophy

We assume people will likely have widely varying needs and desires for a personal database solution. We thought that the best way to meet their needs would be making our system as open ended as possible, but still providing a basic structure that should apply or at least not get in the way for most use cases. This came in the form mainly of container nesting, custom fields, and item templates. With these tools we think most users can selectively keep track of only the things they care about while also having some useful QOL features that can enable more customized and detailed tracking without being too cumbersome to set up and re-use.
