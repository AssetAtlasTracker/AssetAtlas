# 6.4.2 Stakeholder Needs and Requirements Definition process


# 6.4.5 Design Definition process
## Prepare for software system design definition.
### Define the design definition strategy, consistent with the selected life cycle model and anticipated design artifacts.
a. f \
b. XP says to design just enough up front: "Some design up-front is necessary, but just enough to get the initial implementation." XP says incremental design is the way to go, design should only be done as needed.

### Select and prioritize design principles and design characteristics.
a. a \
b. XP says to prioritze design principles needed for the development about to happen: "The advice to XP teams is not to minimize design investment over the short run, but to keep the design investment in proportion to the needs of the system so far"
### Identify and plan for the necessary enabling systems or services needed to support design definition.
a. c \
b. Again, XP would say to only do this if the enabling systems are immediately needed. "Strive to make the design of the system an excellent fit for the needs of the system that day. When your understanding of the best possible design leaps forward, work gradually but persistently to bring the design back into alignment with your understanding." Identify the systems when they become needed and adjust the design to encorporate them then.
### Obtain or acquire access to the enabling systems or services to be used.
a. c \
b. This is the same as the last one, obtain the services when they become needed.
## Establish designs related to each software system element.
### Transform architectural and design characteristics into the design of software system elements.
a. a \
b. Only design software elements needed up front: "Some design up-front is necessary, but just enough to get the initial implementation. Further design takes place once the implementation is in place and the real constraints on the design are obvious"
### Define and prepare or obtain the necessary design enablers.
a. g \
b. XP says not to do this, design alternatives should be considered as they are come across: "When your understanding of the best possible design leaps forward, work gradually but persistently to bring the design back into alignment with your understanding."
### Examine design alternatives and feasibility of implementation.
a. e \
b. XP says not to do this, design alternatives should be considered as they are come across: "When your understanding of the best possible design leaps forward, work gradually but persistently to bring the design back into alignment with your understanding."
### Refine or define the interfaces among the software system elements and with external entities.
a. d \
b. XP says this should only be done when it comes time to create connections with the external entities.
### Establish the design artifacts.
a. f \
b. As with before, design artifacts in XP should only be established when they come up in development.
## Assess alternatives for obtaining software system elements.
### Determine technologies required for each element composing the software system.
a. b \
b. "Some design up-front is necessary, but just enough to get the initial implementation.": XP says to determine the technologies needed for the initial system and worry about the rest as it becomes necessary.
### Identify candidate alternatives for the software system elements.
a. e \
b. As with before, XP says alternatives should only be considered when needed.
### Assess each candidate alternative against criteria developed from expected design characteristics and element requirements to determine suitability for the intended application.
a. e \
b. As with before, XP says alternatives should only be considered when needed.
### Choose the preferred alternatives among candidate design solutions for the software system elements.
a. e \
b. As with before, XP says alternatives should only be considered when needed.
## Manage the design.
### Capture the design and rationale.
a. h \
b. XP says not to directly maintain documentation of the design: "Maintain only the code and the tests as permanent artifacts. Generate other documents from the code and tests." 
### Establish traceability between the detailed design elements, the system/software requirements, and the architectural entities of the software system architecture.
a. h \
b. Because of incremental design, XP considers this traceability temporary: "When we create new, more beneficial relationships between elements, we can spread these relationships to all existing elements." Design elements and relationships will be changed throughout development, so traceability will change and should not be maintained as an artifact.
### Determine the status of the software system and element design.
a. h \
b. XP says this should be a daily activity, "Invest in the design of the system every day. Strive to make the design of the system an excellent fit for the needs of the system that day. When your understanding of the
best possible design leaps forward, work gradually but persistently to bring the design back into alignment with your understanding." Team members should be paying attention to the design to consider changes daily.
### Provide key artifacts and information items that have been selected for baselines.
a. g \
b. As with before, XP says permenant artifacts outside of the code and tests should not be maintained.
