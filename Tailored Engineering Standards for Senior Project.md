# 6.4.2 Stakeholder Needs and Requirements Definition process
## 1. Prepare for Stakeholder Needs and Requirements Definition
### A. Identify the stakeholders who have an interest in the software system throughout its lifecycle

Addressed Outcome: a \
XP emphasizes customer involvement. 
“The point of customer involvement is to reduce wasted effort by putting the people with the needs in direct contact with the people who can fill those needs.”

### B. Define	the stakeholder needs and requirements definition strategy

Addressed Outcome: d \
XP focuses on clear communication of requirements and prioritizing them.
“Plan using units of customer-visible functionality.”

### C. Identify	and plan for the necessary enabling systems or services needed to	support stakeholder needs and requirements definition. 

Addressed Outcome: h \
XP emphasizes simplicity and refinement of processes.Enabling systems aligns with continuous integration and automation.
“The build environment must be smoothly automated. The deployment tools must be automated, including the ability to roll out incrementally and roll back in case of failure.”

### D. Obtain or acquire access to the enabling systems or services to be used.

Addressed Outcome: h \
XP promotes infrastructure for smooth development.
“The build environment must be smoothly automated. The deployment tools must be automated, including the ability to roll out incrementally and roll back in case of failure.”


## 2. Define stakeholder needs.
### A. Define context of use within the concept of operations and the preliminary	life cycle concepts. 

Addressed Outcome: b \
XP likes understanding the operational environment through customer collaboration.
“Defects are addressed in XP by many of the practices: pair programming, continuous integration, sitting together, real customer involvement, and daily deployment, for example.”

### B. Identify stakeholder needs.

Addressed Outcome: d \
In XP, user stories are central to understanding stakeholder needs.
“Plan using units of customer-visible functionality. "Handle five times the traffic with the same response time." "Provide a two-click way for users to dial frequently used numbers." As soon as a story is written, try to estimate the development effort necessary to implement it.”

### C. Prioritize and down-select needs.

Addressed Outcome: e \
In XP, the customer prioritizes which stories they want.
“Have the customers pick a week's worth of stories to implement this week.”

### D. Define the stakeholder needs and rationale.

Addressed Outcomes: d g \
In XP, the dialogue with the customer helps clarify the needs and rationale.
“Defects are addressed in XP by many of the practices: pair programming, continuous integration, sitting together, real customer involvement, and daily deployment, for example.”


## 3. Develop the operational concept and other life cycle concepts.
### A. Define a representative set of scenarios to identify the required capabilities that correspond to anticipated operational and other life cycle concepts.

Addressed Outcomes: b d \
In XP, scenarios are analyzed through user stories and customer feedback
“User stories are short descriptions of functionality told from the perspective of the user”

### B. Identify the factors affecting interactions between users and the system.

Addressed Outcomes: b d f \
XP has things like usability, environmental constraints, and user capabilities affecting interactions. 
“Synchronous builds also create positive pressure for a short, clear feedback cycle. When I get notified of a problem half an hour after starting a new task; I waste a lot of time remembering what I was doing, fixing the problem, and then finding my place in the interrupted task.”


## 4. Develop the operational concept and other life cycle concepts.
### A. Identify the	constraints	on a system	solution

Addressed Outcome: b \
In XP, the use of user stories can help define scenarios and capabilities.

### B. Identify	the	stakeholder	requirements and functions that	relate to critical	quality	characteristics, such as assurance,	safety,	security, environment, or health. 
Addressed Outcome: d f \
In XP, critical quality characteristics, such as assurance, safety, security, and environment, are addressed through continuous customer feedback, traceability, automated testing, and regular iteration review.
“The principles listed here are not the only possible principles to guide software development. In the development of safety-critical systems, for example, the principle of traceability is at work.”

### C. Define Stakeholder Requirements, Consistent with Life Cycle Concepts, Scenarios, Interactions, Constraints, and Critical Quality Characteristics

Addressed Outcomes: e f i \
In XP, defining and refining stakeholder requirements is integral to the process, and is often done via user stories
“User stories are short descriptions of functionality told from the perspective of the user”


## 5. Analyze Stakeholder Requirements
### A. Analyze the complete set of stakeholder requirements.

Addressed Outcomes: e f \
XP emphasizes simplicity and clarity in requirements, with brevity in user stories
“User stories are brief descriptions of functionality told from the perspective of a user.”

### B. Define critical performance measures that enable the assessment of technical achievement.

Addressed Outcome: f \
In XP, testing and feedback loops provide a basis for tracking.
“Some of our customers are great. They write good stories. They write acceptance test criteria. They help testers write acceptance tests.”

### C. Feed back the analyzed requirements to applicable stakeholders to validate that their needs and expectations have been adequately captured and expressed.

Addressed Outcome: g \
XP promotes regular customer feedback to review requirements
“ A programmer out of sync with the deployed software risks making decisions without getting accurate feedback about those decisions.”

### D. Resolve stakeholder requirements issues.

Addressed Outcomes: g i \
XP uses planning poker to resolve requirement issues and create priorities


## 6. Manage the Stakeholder Needs and Requirements Definition
### A. Obtain explicit agreement with designated stakeholders on the stakeholder requirements.

Addressed Outcome: g \
In XP collaboration and customer involvement are essential for agreement.
“Try the same in software development. Figure out how many stories the customer needs each week. Strive to improve development until some of the team members are idle; then you're ready to shrink the team and continue”

### B. Maintain traceability of stakeholder needs and requirements.

Addressed Outcome: i \
In XP, we minimize documentation but maintain traceability. User stories give a clear trail.
“User stories are short descriptions of functionality told from the perspective of the user”

### C. Provide key artifacts and information items that have been selected for baselines.

Addressed Outcome: i \
XP uses stories for documentation.
You can get close, though. This week's stories can become next week's documentation tasks, putting the completion of the documentation one week behind the completion of the stories.




# 6.4.4 Architecture Definition Process .
## 1. Prepare for Architecture Definition.
### A. Review Pertinent Information and Identify Key Drivers of the Architecture.

Addressed Outcome: i \
XP Relation: This is related to incremental design because it is a step in that process. Stories could be used as drivers.

### B. Identify Stakeholder Concerns.

Addressed Outcome: a \
XP Relation: This relates to the XP principle of humanity. Stakeholders are humans too. The team is part of the stakeholder. Identifying what the team needs out of this project as well as what the other stakeholders need is addressing everyone’s humanity.

### C. Define the Architecture Definition Roadmap, Approach, and Strategy.

Addressed Outcome: h \
XP Relation: This relates to the Weekly Cycle of XP. The author states, “Work on gradually reducing the percentage of time you spend planning. Some teams start with a whole day of planning for a week, but gradually refine their planning skills until they spend an hour planning for the week.” In the same way, defining a roadmap, approach, and strategy allows one to reduce the time they spend planning the architecture.

### D. Define Architecture Evaluation Criteria Based on Stakeholder Concerns and Key Requirements.

Addressed Outcome: h \
XP Relation: This is related to the Test-First practice of XP. Evaluation criteria are essentially tests for the design/architecture. 

### E. Identify and Plan for the Necessary Enabling Systems or Services Needed to Support the Architecture Definition Process.

Addressed Outcome: j \
XP Relation: The relation here is the same as described in c. This is a part of planning.

### F. Obtain or Acquire Access to the Enabling Systems to be Used.

Addressed Outcome: j \
XP Relation: This is somewhat related to the 10-Minute Build practice. Most often, the enabling systems will be a part of the 10-Minute Build or design-equivalent process. If testing can be automated for design, it would certainly require enabling systems.


## 2. Develop Architecture Viewpoints
### A. Select, Adapt, or Develop Viewpoints and Model Kinds Based on Stakeholder Concerns.

Addressed Outcome: b \
XP Relation: This is related to the Weekly Cycle. It’s mentioned that customers should “pick a week's worth of stories to implement this week.” at each weekly meeting. In the context of developing architecture, this would be using a stakeholder’s, the customer’s, concerns to guide selection, changes, and development overall.

### B. Establish or Identify Potential Architecture Frameworks to be Used in Developing Models and Views.

Addressed Outcome: c \
XP Relation: This relates to Incremental Design in XP. The requirement for the next step is to have a framework. While the whole design is not yet finished, we take the next step because it is required to make progress.

### C. Capture Rationale for Selection of Frameworks, Viewpoints and Model Kinds.

Addressed Outcome: c \
XP Relation: This relates to the XP value of Communication. Especially if you’re working on this alone, it is important to explain any choices so that teammates can understand. 

### D. Select or Develop Supporting Modelling Techniques and Tools.

Addressed Outcome: c \
XP Relation: This relates to Incremental Design for the same reason b does.


## 3. Develop Models and Views of Candidate Architectures.
### A. Define the Software System Context and Boundaries in Terms of Interfaces and Interactions with External Entities.

Addressed Outcome: c \
XP Relation: This is important to the Communication value of XP. Defining these things can help communicate the design of the system. Additionally, given that in XP we should “Maintain only the code and the tests as permanent artifacts,” this seems counter to XP; however, documents containing such information can be temporarily made, and, once the architecture is implemented, more clearly indicated via clean code.

### B. Identify Architectural Entities and Relationships Between Entities that Address Key Stakeholder Concerns and Critical Software System Requirements.

Addressed Outcome: k \
XP Relation: This is important to Incremental Design. The author says we should “Strive to make the design of the system an excellent fit for the needs of the system that day” as a part of incremental design. By identifying specific entities and relationships, we are narrowing down the selection of what we plan to work on. Thus, we focus on the needs of the system for the day as in incremental design.

### C. Allocate Concepts, Properties, Characteristics, Behaviors, Functions, or Constraints that are Significant to Architecture Decisions of the Software System to Architectural Entities.

Addressed Outcome: e \
XP Relation: This is related to the Code and Tests practice of XP. Instead of having a bunch of documentation, we allocate all the typically documented ideas to architectural entities. In this way, we can reduce if not eliminate the need for extra documentation so long as we can represent these aspects within the coding of architectural entities. 

### D. Select, Adapt, or Develop Models of the Candidate Architectures of the Software System.

Addressed Outcome: d \
XP Relation: This is related to Incremental design for the same reason as explained in b.

### E. Compose Views from the Models in Accordance with Identified Viewpoints to Express How the Architecture Addresses Stakeholder Concerns and Meets Stakeholder and System/Software Requirements

Addressed Outcome: k \
XP Relation: This is related to Communication for similar reasons as a. The only difference here is that the views and models are the temporary documentation.

### F. Harmonize the Architecture and Views with Each Other.

Addressed Outcome: g \
XP Relation: This relates to the idea of Code and Tests as well as Single Code Base. Here, harmonization requires that anything that doesn’t work together is pruned or reworked. This makes the design more concise which will in turn make it easier to understand and easier to express through code instead of superfluous documentation. Then, with the Single Code Base practice, the author gives the example of a team that had seven different code bases and says, “When I pointed out the costs of the multiple code bases and the impossibility of scaling such a practice, the client responded that they simply couldn't afford the work of reuniting the code.” Harmonizing earlier allows the code to be more united from the beginning, preventing the problem of multiple code bases.

## 4. Relate the Architecture to Design.

### A. Identify Software System Elements that Relate to Architectural Entities and the Nature of These Relationships.

Addressed Outcome: f \
XP encourages minimal designing to meet current needs, which aligns with understanding the essential elements and relationships within the architecture, because by identifying critical system elements, you can ensure the architecture supports incremental and iterative development without over-designing.

### B. Define the Interfaces and Interactions Among the Software System Elements and External Entities.

Addressed Outcome: c \
While XP doesn’t particularly encourage defining the architecture upfront, it does still support the idea that defining interfaces and interactions helps in achieving a more cohesive and maintainable design, even when requirements are constantly changing.

### C. Partition, Align and Allocate Requirements to Architecture Entities and System Elements.

Addressed Outcome: i \
XP’s focus on CI helps ensure that the system's components and requirements remain aligned via frequently integrating code and running tests.

### D. Map Software System Elements and Architectural Entities to Design Characteristics.

Addressed Outcome: i \
This standard is fairly misaligned with XP as there is very little design to map system components to, due to XP’s minimalistic documentation/design approach.

### E. Define Principles for the Software System Design and Evolution.

Addressed Outcome: h \
While this task mentions evolution, which is a core philosophy behind XP, this task is rather orthogonal to XP, for similar reasons as the ones specified in task D’s section.

## 5. Assess Architecture Candidates.

### A. Assess Each Candidate Architecture Against Constraints and Requirements.

Addressed Outcome: g \
The rigorous assessment process is contradictory to XP’s focus on rapid work and simplicity.

### B. Assess Each Candidate Architecture Against Stakeholder Concerns Using Evaluation Criteria.

Addressed Outcome: g \
This task is more reasonably aligned with XP due to XP’s focus on stakeholder involvement and feedback. “Make people whose lives and business are affected by your system part of the team.”

### C. Select the Preferred Architectures and Capture Key Decisions and Rationale.

Addressed Outcome: g \
XP specifically dictates to keep as little documentation as possible. “Maintain only the code and the tests as permanent artifacts.”

### D. Establish the Architecture Baseline of the Selected Architecture.

Addressed Outcome: h \
As long as it isn’t exhaustive, XP can benefit from some initial architecture work, to make sure that key attributes of the system are considered from the start. (e.g XP projects could use a minimal architecture baseline to ensure scalability or to meet certain non-functional requirements)

## 6. Manage the Selected Architecture.

### A. Formalize the Architecture Governance Approach and Specify Governance-Related Roles and Responsibilities, Accountabilities, and Authorities Related to Design, Quality, Security and Safety.

Addressed Outcome: i \
This task is thoroughly opposed by the core XP principle of shared code. “Anyone on the team can improve any part of the system at any time.” “The team members can collectively assume responsibility not just for the quality of what they deliver to users but also for the pride they take in their work along the way.”

### B. Obtain Explicit Acceptance of the Architecture by Stakeholders.

Addressed Outcome: k \
Similar to task B from the last section, this task is aligned with XP because of its focus on stakeholder involvement. “Make people whose lives and business are affected by your system part of the team.”

### C. Maintain Concordance and Completeness of the Architectural Entities and Their Architectural Characteristics.

Addressed Outcome: e \
XP’s strong focus on shared code and inner-team collaboration could aid in the fulfillment of this task. While pair programming and heavily communicating with other teammates you are all more likely to keep code tidy and complete.

### D. Organize, Assess and Control Evolution of the Architecture Models and Views to Help Ensure that the Architectural Intent is Met and the Architectural Vision and Key Concepts are Correctly Implemented.

Addressed Outcome: i \
XP heavily discourages the extensive documentation and upkeep of said documentation specified in this task. “Customers pay for what the system does today and what the team can make the system do tomorrow. Any artifacts contributing to these two sources of value are themselves valuable. Everything else is waste.”

### E. Maintain the Architecture Definition and Evaluation Strategy.

Addressed Outcome: h \
This task is partially synergistic with XP’s principles of continuous integration and the emphasis on frequent and early testing, which help maintain the functionality of the architecture and encourage you to adhere to your thorough test cases. Although, this task also implies upkeep of documentation, which is not well aligned with XP.

### F. Maintain Traceability of the Architecture.

Addressed Outcome: k \
Maintaining documentation is counter to XP’s principals. “Maintain only the code and the tests as permanent artifacts.”

### G. Provide Key Artifacts and Information Items that Have Been Selected for Baselines.

Addressed Outcome: h \
For the most part, the only artifacts that XP encourages (other than code) are test cases. “Maintain only the code and the tests as permanent artifacts.”




# 6.4.5 Design Definition process
## 1. Prepare for software system design definition.
### A. Define the design definition strategy, consistent with the selected life cycle model and anticipated design artifacts.

Addressed Outcome: f \
XP says to design just enough up front: "Some design up-front is necessary, but just enough to get the initial implementation." XP says incremental design is the way to go, design should only be done as needed.

### B. Select and prioritize design principles and design characteristics.

Addressed Outcome: a \
XP says to prioritize design principles needed for the development about to happen: "The advice to XP teams is not to minimize design investment over the short run, but to keep the design investment in proportion to the needs of the system so far"

### C. Identify and plan for the necessary enabling systems or services needed to support design definition.

Addressed Outcome: c \
Again, XP would say to only do this if the enabling systems are immediately needed. "Strive to make the design of the system an excellent fit for the needs of the system that day. When your understanding of the best possible design leaps forward, work gradually but persistently to bring the design back into alignment with your understanding." Identify the systems when they become needed and adjust the design to incorporate them then.

### D. Obtain or acquire access to the enabling systems or services to be used.

Addressed Outcome: c \
This is the same as the last one, obtain the services when they become needed.


## 2. Establish designs related to each software system element.
### A. Transform architectural and design characteristics into the design of software system elements.

Addressed Outcome: a \
Only design software elements needed up front: "Some design up-front is necessary, but just enough to get the initial implementation. Further design takes place once the implementation is in place and the real constraints on the design are obvious"

### B. Define and prepare or obtain the necessary design enablers.

Addressed Outcome: g \
XP says not to do this, design alternatives should be considered as they appear: "When your understanding of the best possible design leaps forward, work gradually but persistently to bring the design back into alignment with your understanding."

### C. Examine design alternatives and feasibility of implementation.

Addressed Outcome: e \
XP says not to do this, design alternatives should be considered as they appear: "When your understanding of the best possible design leaps forward, work gradually but persistently to bring the design back into alignment with your understanding."

### D.Refine or define the interfaces among the software system elements and with external entities.

Addressed Outcome: d \
XP says this should only be done when it comes time to create connections with the external entities.

### E. Establish the design artifacts.

Addressed Outcome: f \
As with before, design artifacts in XP should only be established when they come up in development.


## 3. Assess alternatives for obtaining software system elements.
### A. Determine technologies required for each element composing the software system.

Addressed Outcome: b \
"Some design up-front is necessary, but just enough to get the initial implementation.": XP says to determine the technologies needed for the initial system and worry about the rest as it becomes necessary.

### B. Identify candidate alternatives for the software system elements.

Addressed Outcome: e \
As with before, XP says alternatives should only be considered when needed.

### C. Assess each candidate alternative against criteria developed from expected design characteristics and element requirements to determine suitability for the intended application.

Addressed Outcome: e \
As with before, XP says alternatives should only be considered when needed.

### D. Choose the preferred alternatives among candidate design solutions for the software system elements.

Addressed Outcome: e \
As with before, XP says alternatives should only be considered when needed.


## 4. Manage the design.
### A. Capture the design and rationale.

Addressed Outcome: h \
XP says not to directly maintain documentation of the design: "Maintain only the code and the tests as permanent artifacts. Generate other documents from the code and tests."

### B. Establish traceability between the detailed design elements, the system/software requirements, and the architectural entities of the software system architecture.

Addressed Outcome: h \
Because of incremental design, XP considers this traceability temporary: "When we create new, more beneficial relationships between elements, we can spread these relationships to all existing elements." Design elements and relationships will be changed throughout development, so traceability will change and should not be maintained as an artifact.

### C. Determine the status of the software system and element design.

Addressed Outcome: h \
XP says this should be a daily activity, "Invest in the design of the system every day. Strive to make the design of the system an excellent fit for the needs of the system that day. When your understanding of the
best possible design leaps forward, work gradually but persistently to bring the design back into alignment with your understanding." Team members should be paying attention to the design to consider changes daily.

### D. Provide key artifacts and information items that have been selected for baselines.

Addressed Outcome: g \
As with before, XP says permanent artifacts outside of the code and tests should not be maintained.
