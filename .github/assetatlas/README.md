# AssetAtlas Container Registry Info

This document contains information about running AssetAtlas from our container registry, which lets you run AssetAtlas from the command line and with a more minimal initial download. Application data is NOT shared between the ghcr version and GUI-launched version as of (3/27/2025).

## Download Required Files

This application consists of multiple container images.
Docker Compose is used to configure and [run the images together](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/docker-concepts/running-containers/multi-container-applications/).

You can get the required files with either of these methods:

### a. Direct download

[Download ZIP with all files from the latest release](https://github.com/AssetAtlasTracker/AssetAtlas/releases/latest/download/assetatlas-ghcr-files.zip).

It contains the required docker-compose files and a copy of this readme.

### b. Clone from GitHub

Only do this if you'd like to get a development version.

```bash
# requires Node.js
npx degit AssetAtlasTracker/AssetAtlas/ghcr-files assetatlas-ghcr
```

## Running the Containers

Make sure to run these commands in the folder containing the docker-compose files, and that Docker is running.

Run either the Localhost or Tailscale version, depending on your needs.

### a. Localhost

Enables accessing AssetAtlas from the same device you're hosting it on.

For Windows (PowerShell and bash) and Linux/macOS (bash):

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose-ghcr.yml up -d
```

### b. Tailscale

Enables using Tailscale to connect from other devices without additional network configuration.
Replace `your-tailscale-auth-key` with your actual Tailscale auth key.

TODO how to get a tailscale auth key?

For Windows (PowerShell):

```ps
$env:TS_AUTH_KEY="your-tailscale-auth-key"; docker-compose -f docker-compose-ghcr-tailscale.yml up -d
```

For Linux/macOS (bash) or Windows (bash):

```bash
TS_AUTH_KEY="your-tailscale-auth-key" docker compose -f docker-compose-ghcr-tailscale.yml up -d
```

## Stopping the Containers

```bash
# Localhost
docker compose -f docker-compose-ghcr.yml down

# Tailscale
docker compose -f docker-compose-ghcr-tailscale.yml down
```

### Building and Pushing to GHCR (Development)

TODO move these directions somewhere else as users don't care about them.

Build is handled automatically when pushing to production branch. To manually build and push the container image to GitHub Container Registry:

```bash
.\docker\build-and-push.bat AssetAtlasTracker AssetAtlas
```

Enter your GitHub Personal Access Token with package write permissions.

This should be run in projects top level (the provided command includes the pathing to the docker subdirectory).
